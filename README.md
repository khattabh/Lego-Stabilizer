# Lego-Stabilizer
Assembly Mips instructions that balances a lego controller with two sensors and a motor. Needs Altera's DE1-SoC hardware,
recommended using the NIOS II microprocessor.
For optimal results, use a low power motor and place the device on top of a white piece of paper.


If the device is going in one direction only, try switching the value of the motor direction under each sensor's subroutine.
